  <H3>Profile</H3>
    <p class="onlytext"> I have been involved in Information Technology for more than 5 years. My strongest skill is to correlate technology and business to create and define new opportunities. I strongly believe that with the help of the rising technologies, like data analytics or The Internet Of Things you can give more value to any business. 
  
  I consider myself a person who can provide creative and concrete solutions to real problems using open source technologies that fit to the requirement.
  
  My technical skills include the programming languages,  implementation and configuration of networks as well as the penetration testing  relevant to assess the level of computer security.
